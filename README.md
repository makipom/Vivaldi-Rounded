# Vivaldi Rounded
A custom CSS theme for `Vivaldi`, made with mouse gestures and hotkey use in mind.   
Can be used with any theme, both light and dark, taking its accent colors from the selected browser theme.   
Works best with sidebar and address bar hidden (While summoning them, if needed, by pressing F7 and F8 respectively).   

### Key features:

* Rounded "floating" tabs.    
* Transparent sidebar, sidebar menus.    
* "Vivaldi" button, minimize/maximize buttons show only when you hover a cursor over them.    
* No "close" button. To avoid misclicking. Browser can be closed from the main menu.    
* No "new tab" button. To be opened with mouse gestures and/or hotkeys.    
* New appearance for the "Vivaldi" menu button.    
* New tab tiles appear when hovering over them with your cursor.

## Pre-installation     
* Go to `vivaldi://experiments/`  and check `Allow CSS modification`, then restart your browser;     
* Open `Settings → Appearance` and scroll down to see the `Custom UI Modification` option;    
* Create a folder anywhere you want, for example it can be named `VivaldiCSS` in the `Documents` library;     
* Link this folder in the `Custom UI Modification` setting.    
### Installation    
* Download the `vivaldi-rounded.css` file from this repository;    
* Copy the `vivaldi-rounded.css` into the folder you've created in the `Pre-installation` step;     
* Restart your browser.

Works with the latest at the moment (6.0) Stable release of Vivaldi.    
Created this theme for personal use, but since there are not much custom themes for Vivaldi out there, thought that someone might be interested.

Used some of their code in the earlier days, and even though it's mostly different now - if not for this theme, there would've been nothing.
